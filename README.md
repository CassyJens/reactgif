You're viewing the codebase for a single page web app for wasting time written in React.js and Backbone.js. I've created this website as a way to experiment w/different libraries, because who doesn't
love seeing their code run successfully followed by a random animated GIF? It makes life that much better.

To see the website up and running, visit: seabear.heroku.com.
