You're viewing the codebase for a single page web app for wasting time written in React.js and Backbone.js. I've created this website as a way to experiment w/different libraries, because who doesn't
love seeing their code run successfully followed by a random animated GIF? It makes life that much better.

To see the website up and running, visit: seabear.heroku.com.

## Build
```
npm install
```

## Run
```
grunt \\ runs JSX compiler, browserify, and watch
```
in a new tab
```
node index.js \\ starts the server
```
